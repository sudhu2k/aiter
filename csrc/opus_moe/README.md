# Opus MoE

This directory contains Opus MoE stage2 kernels and their Python bindings. The
current code is gfx950-only and intentionally narrow: fused MoE enablement is
case-gated through tuned A8W4 stage2 configs.

There is one active fused MoE path:

- A8W4 decode stage2 kernels for the `a8w4_decode_k3` family:
  `logical_inter_dim=512`, `inter_dim_pad=128`, and runtime `topk`,
  `hidden`, and `experts`.

The `a8w4_decode_k5` metadata family is retained only as a small bring-up
coverage set for the generalized codegen path; it is not part of the tuned DSV4
production target set.

Private BF16/A16W16 stage2 source is retained for future bring-up, but current
JIT generation does not emit BF16 launchers/TUs and no Python user API exposes it.

## Kernel Surfaces

### Private BF16 Stage2 Source

The BF16/A16W16 source remains under `include/gfx950/a16w16/` for future bring-up,
but it is not generated, compiled, or exposed by the current JIT path.

### A8W4 Decode Stage2

The A8W4 path takes:

- `inter_states [token, topk, 512]`, FP8.
- `w2 [expert, hidden, 256]`, FP4x2 packed.
- `a2_scale [route, scale_cols]`, FP8 E8M0.
- `w2_scale [expert * hidden, scale_cols]`, FP8 E8M0.
- CK/Opus MoE sorting metadata and optional `sorted_weights`.
- `out [token, hidden]`, BF16 direct output, BF16 per-slot route output, or
  MXFP8 per-slot route output.

Direct-output kids atomically accumulate into `[token, hidden]`. The BF16
route-out kid writes `[token * topk, hidden]`; the MXFP8 route-out kid writes
`[token * topk, hidden + hidden / 8]` as payload plus scale. Both use the
shared route-output reduce.

Supported A8W4 kernel ids:

Numbering convention:

- `2000-2099`: K3 decode candidates, assigned contiguously.
- `2100-2109`: K5 direct atomic bring-up candidates.
- `2110-2119`: K5 route-output bring-up candidates.

The current K3 active ids are contiguous. Synthetic balanced / round-robin and
full-tile experiments were retired because they are not valid for general MoE
routing.

In fused MoE tuned configs, the preferred A8W4 stage2 selection is a per-kid
`kernelName2` value from the table above. The generic wrapper name
`opus_moe_stage2_a8w4_decode` is still accepted for rows that carry explicit
numeric columns:

- `stage2_kernel_id`: `-1` for direct-atomic auto, or one of the A8W4 kids
  above.
- `stage2_block_m`: the kernel tile M passed to Opus stage2.
- `stage2_route_out`: `1` when stage2 returns per-slot route output that needs
  route-output reduce, otherwise `0`.
- `stage2_reduce_block_n`: optional route-output reduce tile width. Per-kid
  kernel names can also carry this as an `_rbn<N>` suffix, for example
  `opus_moe2_afp8_wfp4_fp8_t64x256x256_sbm64_rbn2816`.

Optional tuned CSV metadata columns `route_bucket`, `expected_sorted_blocks`,
`min_sorted_blocks`, and `max_sorted_blocks` are carried to runtime and checked
after sorting.

  reduce wrapper.
- `aiter/ops/opus/moe_stage2_a8w4_fused_adapter.py`: fused MoE CSV parsing and
  stage2 wrapper glue for A8W4.
- `gen_instances.py`: JIT-time A8W4 manifest/instance generator.
- `opus_moe_common.py`: A8W4 metadata bridge for csrc manifest codegen.

## Tuning and Dispatch

`gen_instances.py` emits `opus_moe_stage2_a8w4_manifest.h` and per-kid A8W4
host/device TUs into the JIT build blob. The manifest is consumed by the A8W4
dispatch wrapper for `kid -> OpusMoeStage2A8W4DecodeShape -> launcher` cases.

A8W4 production selection should be done through the fused MoE tuned
configuration by adding `opus_...` stage2 kernel names only for measured cases
where Opus is correct and faster than the baseline.

## Validation

A8W4 production selection should be validated with model-level traces before
adding or changing tuned CSV entries; local replay manifests and captured routing
dumps should stay outside the repository.

## Current Limits

- gfx950 only.
- Private BF16/A16W16 stage2 source is retained but not generated or exposed.
- A8W4 production tuning currently targets the `a8w4_decode_k3` family:
  `logical_inter_dim=512`, `inter_dim_pad=128`, effective inter dim `384`,
  and runtime `topk`, `hidden`, and `experts`.
- A small `a8w4_decode_k5` bring-up family is generated to keep the generalized
  metadata/codegen path exercised, but it is not production tuned.
- A8W4 direct-output kernels do not support EP `expert_mask/topk_ids` or
  `bias2`.
- A8W4 route-out kids include a BF16 precision fallback and the MXFP8 path used
  for the fastest large-token route-output candidate.
- Final fused MoE enablement should be case-gated through tuned CSV entries, not
  globally enabled for every compatible-looking shape.
